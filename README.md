# Cub3D üê∫

# Project Overview

Cub3D is a tribute to the iconic 90's first-person shooter game "Wolfenstein 3D." This project is not just about gaming nostalgia but also an exploration into the world of ray-casting technology. 
# üß± Building and Running the Game

## Requirements:

- GCC Compiler
- miniLibX Library
- A Linux/Unix environment

## Makefile Commands:

- `make`: Compiles the program.
- `make clean`: Removes object files.
- `make fclean`: Cleans all compiled files.
- `make re`: Re-compiles the program.

## Get Started
- Clone the repository.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Compile with `make`
- Run the program using the command: ```./cub3D <map_file.cub>```

The map must be composed of only 6 possible characters: 0 for an empty space,
1 for a wall, and N,S,E or W for the player‚Äôs start position and spawning
orientation. The .cub file must be formatted as the example bellow:

```
NO ./path_to_the_north_texture
SO ./path_to_the_south_texture
WE ./path_to_the_west_texture
EA ./path_to_the_east_texture
F 220,100,0 -> Floor color
C 225,30,0 -> Ceiling color

# üí° Key Learnings: Raycasting Explained
Ray-casting is a technique that transform a limited form of data (a very simplified map or floor plan) into a 3D projection by tracing rays. The rays are traced from the player point of view into the viewing volume

- Principle: For each column of the screen, a ray is cast from the player's view. The direction of each ray depends on the player's position and the column's x-coordinate.
- Wall Detection: The ray moves forward until it hits a wall. The distance to this hit determines how high the wall appears on the screen.
- Side Determination: The texture of the wall varies based on the side the ray hits, creating a realistic 3D environment.
- Efficiency: The algorithm efficiently calculates the distance to walls and renders only what's visible to the player, optimizing performance.
